Project Title: Musicfy – Static Music Frontend Website (Deployed on AWS)

Project Description:

Musidy is a modern static music-themed web application developed entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a user-friendly, responsive frontend that simulates a music streaming interface. The design includes visually appealing elements such as album sections, playlist cards, and navigation components that create a seamless user experience for music lovers. The main objective of this project was to understand and implement static web hosting using Amazon Web Services (AWS), while building a clean and interactive frontend.

The static website was hosted on Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) by creating a dedicated S3 bucket to store the frontend files. Static website hosting was then enabled by configuring index and error documents. Proper permissions were applied through Bucket Policies to allow public read access, ensuring that users could access the content globally without authentication. The deployment was further enhanced using AWS Amplify, which acts as a scalable deployment platform for modern web applications. Amplify provided a unique URL to access the project and manage deployments with ease.

This project helped in learning various AWS services including S3 configuration, access control via IAM and policies, and Amplify’s CI/CD capabilities. The experience also solidified the understanding of cloud infrastructure concepts and frontend deployment workflows. While the application is static and doesn’t have backend functionality yet, it sets the foundation for future integration with databases, media servers, or cloud functions using services like AWS Lambda or Firebase.

Musidy reflects not just frontend development skills, but also practical cloud hosting knowledge, making it a strong portfolio piece for web development and DevOps roles. The project demonstrates the ability to create, configure, and deploy a professional-grade static website using AWS technologies, which are widely used in industry.
